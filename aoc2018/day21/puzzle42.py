"""
The problem description is quite confusing, but the key is "to halt after executing the most instructions":
If there were an infinite number of distinct values for r1 upon checking r1 == r0, then there would always be 
another value for r0, such that r0 initialized with that value would result in more instructions being executed
before halting. Hence, the number of values for r1 must be limited, so we can check for reoccurences by recording
all values of r1. Since execution of the interpreted assembly code this is rather slow, the code should be
translated and optimized:

r1 = 0
seen = set()

    r5 = r1 | 65536
    r1 = 8586263

        r2 = r5 & 255
        r1 = r1 + r2
